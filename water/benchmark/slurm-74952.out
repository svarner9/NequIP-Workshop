 -- Results --
PLEASE NOTE: these are speeds for the MODEL, evaluated on --n-data=1 configurations kept in memory.
    \_ MD itself, memory copies, and other overhead will affect real-world performance.

The average call took 17.55ms
Assuming linear scaling — which is ALMOST NEVER true in practice, especially on GPU —
    \_ this comes out to 45.7031 us/atom/call
For this system, at a 1.00fs timestep, this comes out to 4.92 ns/day
